# DESCRIPTION
Have you ever thought the 3 attributes: strength, agility and intelligence aren't enough? Well, this mod switches them with 7 attributes you would find in an rpg game.

You get 5 attribute points every level you can allocate however you want, you also start with 18 points.
Heroes start with 4 in all attributes and also gain 1 point in all attributes every level.

You can access the attribute menu by clicking the plus icon in the right bottom corner of your hero portrait or press "P" to toggle the menu.

There is also a respec tome you can use to respec your attributes.

The 4 iconic classes from rpgs also return.
